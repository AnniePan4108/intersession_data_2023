R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.

#Download R from CRAN

CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. It is suggested to use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.

1. View the list of mirrors by navigating to [https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

2. Once you select the mirror nearest to you, you should be presented with a page (see below) that has links to download R for your specific operating system.

#What is RStudio?

#Download RStudio Desktop

1. Navigate to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

2. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and install RStudio.

#Utilizing RStudio

1. Once you open the RStudio application on your machine, you can utilize the version of R that you downloaded by using the "Console". Here you can run a single line of code and have the result be returned. 
2. If you are unfamiliar with R programming syntax, please try out the interactive primer found at [https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2] (https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2) to learn the programming basics
3. One value of RStudio is that you can view and edit R scripts in the window as running code in the console. R scripts are how you can save lines of code in a file to run in the future. When saved R scripts have the naming syntax 'filename.R'.
