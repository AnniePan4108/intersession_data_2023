## Day 2 - Thursday January 5th 

### GitHub Tutorial

Git is a popular version control software that is very helpful in tracking versions of code during the development process. It keeps track of every file in the project repository and allows you to restor previous versions if things go wrong. GitHub allows you to host projects remotely so that multiple people can contribute to a project without contributors having to email each other files titled 'script_version_13_final_final.R'. Especially when working on projects where multiple people are contributing to code, it's easy to lose track of which version is the most up to date and things can go wrong if an important piece of code is overwritten in an update. GitHub's features also come in handy when working on a project by yourself, not only for the version control capabilities, but also because you can access your project from multiple machines if you have an internet connection. <br>

To get practice with GitHub in this class, we will be adding data analyses and visualizations to the class GitHub. You are also welcome to create your own GitHub repositories for your class projects. <br> 

1. Getting started
- Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/join <br>
- Install Git on your machine: <br>
	- If you are working on a mac or linux, you may already have Git installed. To check if you have git installed already, launch terminal and type the command `git version`  <br>
	- If not, you can download and install git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads <br>
