### RStudio (and R) Tutorial

#### What is R?

R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.

#### Download R from CRAN

CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. It is suggested to use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.

1. View the list of mirrors by navigating to [https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

2. Once you select the mirror nearest to you, you should be presented with a page (see below) that has links to download R for your specific operating system.

3. Choose the appropriate link and follow the provided instructions to download the R for your operating system.

#### What is RStudio?

The RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) is a set of tools built to help you be more productive with R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution. It also features tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.

#### Download RStudio Desktop

1. Navigate to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

2. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and install RStudio.

#### Utilizing RStudio

1. Once you open the RStudio application on your machine, you can utilize the version of R that you downloaded by using the "Console". Here you can run a single line of code and have the result be returned.

2. To become familiarized with R programming syntax, please try out the interactive primer found at [https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2) to learn the programming basics.
3. One value of RStudio is that you can view and edit R scripts in the same window as running code in the console. R scripts are how you can save lines of code in a file to run in the future. R scripts have the naming syntax 'filename.R' when saved. Practice creating and saving R scripts onto your local machine by utilizing the icons at the top left.
